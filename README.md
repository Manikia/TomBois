<br>
Helping local restraurant by improving online websites to promote meals to the public.

To Do
- [x] Separate sections like tabs and header with nav bars since its all piled in one DIV
- [x] Find more pleasing photos to promote online _in progress_
<br>
<strike> Create maquee banner with burger?
<br>Create hyperlink on locations and carousel that changes location based on what Tomboys youre looking at </strike>

- [x] make logos with transparent background
- [x] Make nav bar mobile friendly
  - [ ] Taking too much time to fix links so its on standby while we work on other parts
- [ ] Create a footer:
  - [ ] contact info link
  - [ ] copyright
  - [ ] types of credit cards accepted
  - [ ] Creating Social media links
- [ ] Make header larger to make it stand out from the smaller text (font bigger)
- [ ] refactor css into their own files (ex. footer.css, map.css, etc.).
- [ ] Look at other fast food restraurants for reference. (Using up all the page with large images/carousels)
- [ ] On the nav bar, use the same colors (the blue and red) used from the website. Add a second small stripe to match it.
- [ ] Make some of the text inside the menu tables bold
- [ ] Create a menu with borders that reflect logo colors and can be used as a base of the menu for each tab
